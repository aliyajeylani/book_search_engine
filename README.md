# book_search_engine

# Description
  This week's challenge was to take a website that was build with a Restful API and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The application was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. The application allows users to search for books and save their favorite books. Replacing the existing Restful API to allowed me to fetch and modify data from the front end to the back end
